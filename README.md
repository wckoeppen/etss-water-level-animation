# etss-water-level-animation
This repository is a python project to build animations of storm surge from the [ETSS](https://www.nws.noaa.gov/mdl/etsurge/) model and observed water levels from [CO-OPS NWLON stations](https://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/nwlon.html) on a basemap.

It's primary purpose is to make me a better programmer by using the github ecosystem to manage the repo and a testing framework.

## Disclaimer
This package is in the early stages of design and development.

## Data Locations
- This project assumes a local location for ETSS model results in NetCDF format.
